# Arq Backup

## Why I recommend it

Arq Backup is a powerful alternative to subscription-based backup services, offering a one-time purchase model and exceptional flexibility in how and where you store your backups.

## What it does well

The standout feature of Arq is its flexibility. Unlike services like Backblaze that bundle storage with the software, Arq lets you choose where to store your backups. It supports numerous destinations including:

- Amazon S3 and Glacier
- Backblaze B2
- Google Drive and Cloud Storage
- Dropbox
- OneDrive
- SFTP servers
- NAS devices
- External drives

This flexibility means you can shop around for the cheapest storage option or use storage you already pay for.

The encryption is also top-notch. All data is encrypted on your computer before being uploaded, with only you holding the encryption keys.

## Where it could be better

The main downside to Arq is its complexity. The interface presents many more options than simpler backup solutions, which can be overwhelming for less technical users.

Additionally, while the one-time purchase model saves money long-term, the upfront cost plus whatever storage you choose can be higher initially than subscription services.

## Who should use it

Arq is ideal for:
- People who prefer to pay once for software
- Technical users who want granular control
- Those who already have cloud storage they can use
- Users with privacy concerns who want to control their encryption keys

I used Arq for several years before switching to Backblaze, and I still recommend it to friends who prefer more control over their backup strategy.
