# Backblaze Cloud Backup Review

Backblaze offers unlimited cloud backup for just $7/month. It's my go-to recommendation for simple, reliable computer backups.

## What is Backblaze?

Backblaze is a cloud backup service that offers unlimited storage for a fixed monthly fee. It's designed to be simple and straightforward, backing up all your files automatically without requiring much configuration.

## Key Features

- **Unlimited backup**: No file size or type restrictions
- **Automatic backups**: Once set up, it runs in the background
- **Versioning**: 30-day file version history by default (upgradable)
- **Restore options**: Web download, USB drive, or physical hard drive delivery
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows and Mac
- **Mobile access**: View and download your backed-up files from your phone

## Performance

In my testing, Backblaze's initial backup speed was reasonable given my internet connection. The desktop app is lightweight and doesn't noticeably impact system performance. The web interface is clean and easy to navigate.

## Pricing

Backblaze offers a simple pricing model:
- $7/month per computer
- $70/year per computer (saving about $14)
- $130 for two years per computer (additional savings)

No tiers or complicated plans - just one price for unlimited storage.

## Verdict

Backblaze strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and features. It's not the most feature-rich backup solution, but it offers everything most people need at a reasonable price. The unlimited storage without file restrictions is particularly valuable.

For most home users looking for reliable, set-it-and-forget-it backup, Backblaze is my top recommendation.
