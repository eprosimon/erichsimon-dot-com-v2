- **Global distribution**: Data is automatically distributed globally

- **Access controls**: Granular permissions and access policies

## Performance

## Pricing

R2's pricing model is straightforward:
- Storage: $0.015 per GB per month
- Class A operations (PUT, POST, LIST): $4.50 per million requests
- Class B operations (GET): Free
- Data transfer OUT: Free (this is the big differentiator)

Free tier includes:
- 10 GB of storage per month
- 10 million Class A operations per month
- Unlimited Class B operations
