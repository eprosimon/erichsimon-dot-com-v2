# Backblaze

## Why I recommend it

Backblaze is my go-to recommendation for personal computer backup because it solves the most important problem - having a complete offsite backup of your data - with minimal fuss and at a reasonable price.

## What it does well

Backblaze excels at simplicity. The setup is straightforward: install the application, let it run its initial scan, and you're protected. It backs up everything by default (with sensible exclusions for system files), so you don't need to worry about forgetting to include important folders.

The unlimited storage is a genuine standout feature. Many backup services either cap your storage or charge based on how much you use, which adds uncertainty to your monthly bill. With Backblaze, whether you have 1GB or 10TB of data, the price is the same.

## Where it could be better

Backblaze isn't perfect for everyone. Each license only covers a single computer, so costs can add up if you have multiple machines. Also, while the default 30-day file version history is adequate for many users, it's less than some competitors offer.

It also doesn't directly support NAS devices on the personal plan - you'd need their B2 service for that, which works differently and is priced based on storage used.

## Who should use it

Backblaze is ideal for:
- Individual users who want hassle-free backup
- People with large amounts of data (photographers, videographers)
- Those who prefer simple, predictable pricing
- Users who want an easy recovery process including physical restore options

I've personally used Backblaze for over 5 years and have successfully recovered from both small accidental deletions and a complete drive failure.
