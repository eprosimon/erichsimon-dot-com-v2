# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog built with Next.js and MDX. This is a sample post to demonstrate how MDX works in this blog.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Code Example

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
}
