# Hello World! (Markdown)

Welcome to my new blog built with Next.js and Markdown. This is a sample post to demonstrate how Markdown works in this blog.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It's designed to be easy to write and easy to read.

## Code Example

\`\`\`jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
}
