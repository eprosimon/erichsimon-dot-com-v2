# Building My Homelab

This is an ongoing project documenting my journey building a homelab for self-hosting services, learning about infrastructure, and experimenting with new technologies.

## Project Goals

1. Set up a reliable home server environment for hosting essential services
2. Learn more about networking, virtualization, and infrastructure management
3. Reduce dependency on third-party cloud services where possible
4. Create a practical learning environment for experimenting with new technologies

## Hardware Setup

My current homelab setup consists of:

- **Server**: Dell OptiPlex 7060 Micro (i5-8500T, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe)
- **NAS**: Synology DS920+ (4-bay, 16TB total storage)
- **Networking**: Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine Pro + Switch Lite 16 PoE
- **Power Backup**: APC BX1500M UPS

## Software Stack

The core software components:

- **Hypervisor**: Proxmox VE 7.4
- **Containers**: Docker + Portainer
- **Automation**: Ansible + Home Assistant
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + Prometheus + InfluxDB

## Current Services

I'm currently running the following services:

- Nginx Proxy Manager
- Pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking
- Bitwarden password manager
- Home Assistant for home automation
- Nextcloud for file storage and synchronization
- Jellyfin media server
- Paperless-ngx document management

## Project Posts

This project is divided into several posts covering different aspects of the homelab journey:

1. **[Homelab Hardware Guide](blog/homelab-hardware-guide)** - Choosing the right hardware components
2. **[Networking Basics](blog/networking-basics)** - Setting up the network infrastructure
3. **[Proxmox Setup](blog/proxmox-setup)** - Installing and configuring Proxmox VE
4. **[Docker Essentials](blog/docker-essentials)** - Working with containers and Portainer
5. **[Self-Hosted Services](blog/self-hosted-services)** - Setting up essential services
6. **[Homelab Monitoring](blog/homelab-monitoring)** - Monitoring the system with Grafana and Prometheus

## Future Plans

- Expand storage capacity
- Implement proper backup solutions
- Add CI/CD pipeline for personal projects
- Explore Kubernetes for container orchestration
