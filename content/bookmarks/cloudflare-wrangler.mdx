# Cloudflare Wrangler CLI

Wrangler is the official CLI tool for Cloudflare Workers, making it easy to develop, test, and deploy serverless functions directly to Cloudflare's edge network.

## Why it's bookmarked

I use Wrangler regularly for my serverless projects on Cloudflare. It provides a seamless development experience with features like:

- Local development environment that mimics the Workers runtime
- Simple deployment commands
- Easy management of KV namespaces, Durable Objects and other Worker resources
- Built-in secret management
- Typescript support out of the box

## Getting started

Install Wrangler via npm:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

Then authenticate with your Cloudflare account:

```bash
wrangler login
```

Create a new Worker project:

```bash
wrangler init my-worker
```

## Useful commands

Some of the most useful Wrangler commands:

- `wrangler dev`: Start a local development server
- `wrangler publish`: Deploy your Worker to Cloudflare
- `wrangler secret put KEY`: Add a secret to your Worker
- `wrangler kv:namespace create NAME`: Create a KV namespace
